/*Hereâ€™s a concise algorithm for the provided C program that implements the FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) disk scheduling algorithm:

### Extremely Brief Algorithm: FCFS Disk Scheduling

1. **Input:** Read `t` (total tracks), `n` (number of requests), `arr[]` (track requests), and `head` (initial head position).
2. **Process Requests:** 
   - For each request in `arr[]`:
     - Calculate distance from the current track to the requested track.
     - Accumulate total seek count.
     - Update the previous track to the current request.
3. **Output:** Print seek sequence and total number of seek operations.

This version captures the core process of the FCFS algorithm in the most concise form possible.*/

    printf("Seek Sequence is\n");
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        cur_track = arr[i];
        // calculate absolute distance
        distance = fabs(prev_track - cur_track);
        // increase the total count
        seek_count += distance;
        // accessed track is now new head
        prev_track = cur_track;
