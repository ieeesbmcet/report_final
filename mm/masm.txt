STEPS TO EXECUTE A PROGRAM
STEP 1             Open 


STEP2 	         mount c  c:/8086
STEP 3          c:
STEP 4          edit (new window will appear > type pgm>save as â€“ pgm name.asm >alt f1)
STEP 5          masm filename.asm (object file will be created)
STEP 6         link filename (exe file will be created)
STEP 7         filename.exe ( program will be executed)

MASM Program to Perform Addition 
1. Prompt for the first number.
2. Read the first number.
3. Prompt for the second number.
4. Read the second number.
5. Add the two numbers.
6. Adjust for BCD.
7. Display the sum.

MASM Program to Perform Subtraction
1. Prompt for the first number.
2. Read the first number.
3. Prompt for the second number.
4. Read the second number.
5. Subtract the second number from the first.
6. Adjust for BCD.
7. Display the difference.

Algorithm to Display a String
1. Initialize the data segment.
2. Load the string address into DX.
3. Set AH to `09h`.
4. Call `int 21h` to display the string.
5. Exit the program with `int 21h`.
These steps summarize the main logic of each program without going into detail.
